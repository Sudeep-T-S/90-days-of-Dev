# ðŸ“… Day 63 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Graphs Kruskal's Algorithm(MST)

- **LeetCode (Solved):**  
  â€¢ Minimum Path Sum (Problem #64)
  â€¢ Edit Distance (Problem #72)
  â€¢ Coin Change (Problem #322)

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Dived into Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm today â€” a classic greedy approach for building MSTs by sorting edges. It was interesting to compare it with Primâ€™s Algorithm from yesterday and see how both solve the same problem with different strategies.
