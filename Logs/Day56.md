# ðŸ“… Day 56 of 90  

## âœ… What I Did Today  
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Adjacency Matrix

- **LeetCode (Solved):**  
  â€¢ Partition Equal Subset Sum (Problem #416)  
  â€¢ Last Stone Weight II (Problem #1049)  

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts  
Today I explored graph representation using adjacency matrix, which is a neat way to visualize connections but can be space-heavy for sparse graphs. On the problem-solving side, tackling Partition Equal Subset Sum and Last Stone Weight II really reinforced dynamic programming concepts.
