## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA**: Learned about classes of functions and asymptotic notations (Big O, Î©, Î˜)
- **LeetCode**: Solved  
   - Search Insert Position (Problem #35)  
   - Fibonacci Numbers (Problem #509)
- **Java**: Revised methods, increment/decrement operators
- **Operating System**: Explored context switching, convoy effect, and CPU scheduling algorithms

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Making solid progress in theory and coding. Leetcode is helping me grasp practical DSA patterns. Staying consistent is paying off.
