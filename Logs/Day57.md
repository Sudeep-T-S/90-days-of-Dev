## ðŸ’­ Thoughts  
Kicked off my Spring Boot journey today, while also exploring the basics of System Design in software engineering. On the DSA side, I implemented adjacency lists for graphs, which really helped strengthen graph fundamentals.
Solved Jump Game I & II, which gave me great practice with greedy and dynamic programming strategies. Excited about this new phase that combines coding, backend, and architecture!
