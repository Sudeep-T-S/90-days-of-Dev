# ðŸ“… Day 62 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Graphs Prim's Algorithm(MST)

- **LeetCode (Solved):**  
  â€¢ Unique Paths (Problem #62)
  â€¢ Unique Paths II (Problem #63)

- **SpringBoot:**  
  â€¢ REST API

- **System Design:**  
  â€¢ availability

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Focused on Primâ€™s Algorithm for MST â€” a great extension of graph optimization. Solved Unique Paths I & II, both excellent dynamic programming problems to strengthen grid-based pathfinding logic.
