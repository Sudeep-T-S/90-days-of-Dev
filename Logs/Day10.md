# ðŸ“… Day 10 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA**: Studied Quick Sort â€“ recursive breakdowns and partition logic
- **LeetCode**: Solved  
   - Contains Duplicate (Problem #217)  
   - Product of Array Except Self (Problem #238)
- **Java**: Practiced commonly used built-in String functions
- **Operating System**: Understood the concept of Deadlock â€“ conditions, prevention, and avoidance

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Quick sort felt refreshingly elegant once the partition logic clicked. Solving LeetCode #238 was a real test of prefix/suffix logic. Deadlocks in OS remind me why resource handling is critical!
