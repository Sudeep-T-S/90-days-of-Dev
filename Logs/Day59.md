# ðŸ“… Day 59 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Graph Breadth First Search

- **LeetCode (Solved):**  
  â€¢ Maximal Square (Problem #221)
  â€¢ Longest Common Subsequence (Problem #1143)

- **SpringBoot:**  
  â€¢ Maven

- **System Design:**  
  â€¢ Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Todayâ€™s progress connected both fundamentals and architecture. Practiced BFS traversal in graphs, then solved two important DP problems â€” Maximal Square and LCS, both great for strengthening dynamic programming.
