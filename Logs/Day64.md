# ðŸ“… Day 64 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Graphs Dijkstra's Algorithm(Shortest Path)

- **LeetCode (Solved):**  
  â€¢ Unique Binary Search Trees (Problem #96)
  â€¢ Unique Binary Search Trees II (Problem #95)

- **SpringBoot:**  
  â€¢ ORM, JPA, Spring Data JPA

- **System Design:**  
  â€¢ Consistency

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Today was all about shortest paths and structure.
I implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, understanding how greedy + priority queues give efficient shortest path solutions in weighted graphs.
On LeetCode, I solved Unique BST I & II, strengthening concepts around Catalan numbers, recursion, and dynamic programming in tree construction.
