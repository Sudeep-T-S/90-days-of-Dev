# ðŸ“… Day 49 of 90  

## âœ… What I Did Today  
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Binary Search Tree  

- **LeetCode:**  
  â€¢ Network Delay Time (Problem #743)  
  â€¢ Path With Minimum Effort (Problem #1631)  

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts  
Focused on Binary Search Trees today â€” insertion, properties, and traversal logic. Also tackled graph-based problems on LeetCode involving shortest paths and minimum effort traversal, which sharpened my understanding of graph algorithms.
