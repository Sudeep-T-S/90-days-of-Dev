# ðŸ“… Day 42 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA:** 
  â€¢ Linked List

- **LeetCode (Optimized):**  
  â€¢ Permutations (Problem #46)  
  â€¢ Combinations (Problem #77)  
  â€¢ Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Problem #104)  

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Focused on Linked List fundamentals and went back to re-optimize recursive problems. Progress feels more stable with each iteration.
