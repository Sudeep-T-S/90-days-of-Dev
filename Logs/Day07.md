# ðŸ“… Day 7 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA**: Practiced Binary Search (Recursive and Iterative approaches)
- **LeetCode**: Solved  
   - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Problem #26)  
   - Merge Sorted Array (Problem #88)

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Wrapped up the week by revising everything I learned so far. Took a break from Java and OS this weekend, but kept the momentum going strong with DSA and LeetCode!
