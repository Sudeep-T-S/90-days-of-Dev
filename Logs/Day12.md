# ðŸ“… Day 12 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- **DSA**: Explored more patterns and problems using Greedy Algorithms
- **LeetCode**: Solved  
   - Longest Common Prefix (Problem #14)  
   - Reverse String (Problem #344)
- **Java**: Studied Inheritance â€“ understanding how classes reuse and extend functionality
- **Operating System**: Deep dive into Paging and Segmentation techniques for memory management

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
Greedy continues to be surprisingly efficient when applied right. Also, revisiting basic string problems helped me brush up on core fundamentals.
