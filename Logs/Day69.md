# ðŸ“… Day 69 of 90

## âœ… What I Did Today
- LeetCode (Solved):  
  â€¢ Jump Game IV (Problem #1345)
  â€¢ Jump Game V (Problem #1340)

- SpringBoot:  
  â€¢ MogoDB Relationships

- System Design:  
  â€¢ Load Balancer

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts
The Jump Game series is getting progressively tougher - todayâ€™s problems pushed me to think about BFS + dynamic programming combinations and how to optimize traversal across states.
