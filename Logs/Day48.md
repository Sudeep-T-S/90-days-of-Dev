# ðŸ“… Day 48 of 90  

## âœ… What I Did Today  
- **DSA:**  
  â€¢ Binary Tree Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order Traversal  

- **LeetCode:**  
  â€¢ Is Graph Bipartite? (Problem #785)  
  â€¢ Find if Path Exists in Graph (Problem #1971)  

- **Java:**  
  â€¢ Streams  

- **Networking:**  
  â€¢ Checksum, Timers  

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts  
Explored multiple traversal techniques of Binary Trees, solidifying tree fundamentals. Solved graph problems covering bipartite checks and path existence.
